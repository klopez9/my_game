* This is a bare-bones version of the battle phase of the game. In future versions, the player will be exploring different rooms, and there will be a chance for an enemy encounter every time the player enters a new room. This serves as a preview to the format of the battle phase for the main game.

* All Characters have three actions: melee attack, magic attack, or rest
* Attacks consume Stamina or Magic depending on type
